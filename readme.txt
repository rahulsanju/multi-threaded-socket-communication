Socket-Programming using python:
-> This project is to implement a simple version of FTP client and FTP server.
-> It uses Sockets to establish communication with the client and the server.
-> FTP Server is run by using the command "python server.py"
-> FTP Client is run by using the command "python client_1.py"
    -> To connect to the server use the command "ftpclient 8080"(8080 is the port server runs on)
-> This establishes the connection between the client and the server.
-> "get <file name>" command will download a file from the server to the client with "new_<file name>".
-> "upload <file name>" command will upload a file from the client to the server with "new_<file name>".
-> The above commands can be run continuously until either server or client disconnects.
-> This server supports multiple clients at any given instance.
-> To run a separate instance of the client enter the command "python client_1.py". This creates the connection in a new thread.
